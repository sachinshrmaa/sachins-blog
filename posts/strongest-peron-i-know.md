No matter which day it is - Sunday or Monday, no matter how tired or sick she feels, she always rises and shines.

No matter how big is your mistake, she always forgives as if nothing happened.

No matter how stupid and silly your dreams are, she has more faith in you than you have.

She may be hungry, but she always fills your stomach first.

She sacrifices her dreams to make your dreams come true.

No one else can care for you the way she does.

To all the young and aged mothers, working mothers and housewives, married mothers, and single mothers, those with money and without and for those without whom life would have been insufferable.

Wish you a very Happy Mother's Day!!
