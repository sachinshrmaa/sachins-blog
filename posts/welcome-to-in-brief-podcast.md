I love learning new things by watching YouTube videos, reading books, or talking to someone, and I enjoy the last one the most.

So allow me to introduce you to my podcast — “In Brief with Sachin”, a podcast where I break down complex topics and ideas in a simpler and more fun way with the help of knowledgeable experts in the fields.

In each episode, our experts share their knowledge, experiences, stories, and perspectives with us. we explore everything from science and technology to history and culture. No matter what the topic, our guests and I make sure we come away with a better understanding of the world around us.
